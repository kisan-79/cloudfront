## Cloudfront - signed url for private content

The project will generate a signed URL for accessing the private file in the S3 bucket through the CloudFront distribution. This signed URL will be valid for 5 minutes.

## Customization

You can customize the project as needed by modifying the code to handle different CloudFront distributions, key pairs, or file paths. Make sure to adjust the expiration time and other settings to fit your requirements.

## Acknowledgments

- The project uses the AWS SDK for Java to interact with AWS services.
